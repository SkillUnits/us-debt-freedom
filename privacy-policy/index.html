                    At Debts Relief US, we believe in transparent and honest advertising practices. We will never place unsolicited “cold-calls” to you. In the past, consumers have told us that they are receiving calls from a group that is falsely using our name (Debts Relief US) without our permission. The group claims that they are us, and even goes as far as using our name in their Caller ID. They claim they are seeking to collect a debt on our behalf and attempt to obtain payment information from you via telephone. None of this is true, we don’t call you to collect on debts, and, in fact, we have reported these violators to law enforcement agencies. Please protect yourself and don’t be fooled.
